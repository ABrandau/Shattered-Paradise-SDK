## Dummy usage:
## 1. Add 'KillsSelf' for timer control, better with '@TimedLife''
## 2. HACK&Note: if you want to trigger the death effect traits, actor must have Health and HitShape.
## Otherwise 'KillsSelf' only dispose the actor without triggering death effect traits.
## 3. You can use '^Unkillable' to avoid other damage kills the actor.
## 4. If you only need a animation when dummy is disposed, use 'WithDisposedAnimation' instead of `^EnableDummyDeathEffects`
