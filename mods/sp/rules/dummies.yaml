## Dummy usage:
## 1. Add 'KillsSelf' for timer control, better with '@TimedLife''
## 2. HACK&Note: if you want to trigger the death effect traits, actor must have Health.
## Otherwise 'KillsSelf' only disposals the actor without triggering death effect traits.
## 3. You can use '^Unkillable' to avoid other damage kills the actor.
